Interview was through google meet
=
P1
-
- You were there for the MS interview right(Same sir from my MS interview)
Yes sir
- Ok, is there any preference for you MS or Direct \
Sir, I definately want to do PHD in future sir, so
- What if you get offer for both? \
I would choose direct PHD sir
- Ok, Introduce you to others
- I think we can continure yesturday \
Yes sir, yeaturday I got stuck on Naive Bias sir
- Ok can you explain it now \
Expains the bias rule
- It is just bias theorem right \
Yes but we also consider each feature x1,x2..xn are indipendnet so that we can calculate the P(x1,x2,x3..xn|Y)=P(x1|y)P(x2|y)..P(xn|y)
- What is its advantage \
Sir we have less canculation if we don't consider indipendance we have to find the intersecton which is more calculations
- What are we estimating, how to estimate the parameters\
Sir we can use techniques like MLE,MAP
- what is MLE \
Maximum likelyhood estimation
- You said prior probability right, how can we found out it \
From the data sir
- You are given with 700 spam and 300 non spam what is the prior for spam \
300/1000
- Ok actually I said 700 spam.How to estimate the P(word|spam) \
sir take all the spam examples and find out how many of them contains the word
- What if we give a word never present in the input \
In the case I expained it will be 0 sir, but in order to avoid it we can use log so that the product become sum(log likelyhood)
- Then what is log(0) \
sir I read it from somewhere and I didn't really think about it
- Now think
Sir I think I read somewhere that we can take one positive and negative example in order to avoid the 0 issue(Laplace prior)
- Forget whatever you read and think
(Not seems to to anywhere)

P2
-
- You know probability right,random variable, uniform distribution,indipendance \
Yes sir
- You are given with 2 indipendent random variables X,Y both uniformy distribured in [0,1], what is the PDF of Z=max(X,Y)
(Confused)
- First draw the pdf of X,Y \
(Draw the graph)
- What is the Y codinate value \
1 sir
- Why?
Sir integral -infinity to infinity PDF is 1 sir and the fundtion is distrubuted in [0,1] so the are inorder to be 0 Y should be 1 sir
- Ok now what about the question, let me ask you first a question, what is the probability that Z<0.5 \ 
0.25
- Why?\
Because X<.5 with p 0.5 and Y<0.5 with p 0.5
- ok, How did you multiply them? Your answer is correct I am looking for one word if you know it or not \
Because they are Indipendent
- Ok now the answer
(thinking)
- Let me ans another thing what is the probability that Z<a \
a*a
- Does that help you?\
I think yes sir \
(Draw the y=x^2 and y=2x and show)
- which one is pdf? what is Y \
(show the Y=2x) this one sir and Y max value is 2
- Why? \
Sir the P(Z<a)=a^2 is the CDF so by taking the derivative we get the y=2x which is the pdf
- Ok
