- Introduce yourself
- There are two parts for this interview one is programming question and another one topic you can choose from the list \
I will choose DBMS sir
- Write the syntax for given with a array of pointer which points to set of strings \
(Write it board)
- Ok your question is you are given with a array of pointer which points to set of strings, check whether your name is in it or not \
(Write the program)
- What are you looking?\
I am not sure whether I passed the arguments correctly or not sir
- Why there is a not operator in the if condition \
Sir I belive the strcmp() return 0 when the strings are equal and non zero when not, not will negate it

(I was not expecting that)
- What is a schedule \
It is an arrangement of transation which contain operations like read and write ordered in a specific way \
- What is recoverability
(Explain the dirty read)
- Is that recoverable
It is irrecoverable
- How can we ensure that \
There are techniques like locking protocol strict and rigorous protocol, in strict all exclusive locks relatsed after the commit point and in regorous we release all locks after commit point
- What is serializability
It is a order of operations which result as if they are done one after the another
- How can we ensure that
we can use 2PL
- Does recoverability mean serializability?
No sir
- Does serializability mean recoverability?
No sir
- One final question 3NF and BCNF which one is more stricter \
BCNF, it allow only super keys on the LHS
- Why we use 3NF over BCNF
Sir we can not always ensure a BCNF one but using the 3NF synthesis algotithm we can always convert into 3NF(Pause for a bit)
- You want to say something right\
Sir I am not getting the exact term
- Does it have anything to do with decomposition? What are the properties of decomposition
Dipendancy preserving and (Lost lossless)
