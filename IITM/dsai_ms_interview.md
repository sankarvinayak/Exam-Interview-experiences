Interview was through google meet
=

- Introduce yourself
- You know linearalgebra right, lets start with it. \
ok sir
- What is linear indipendence? \
It is when we can not  create one vector as linear combination of others,or only trivial solution exist for Ax=0
- You are given with a set of vectors, how large it can be such that if I choose any arbitary 2 vectors thay will be LI \
(Thinking)
- Can you give be 3 vectors such that they any two are LI \
[1 0]T,[0,1]T,[1,1]
- Ok now can you give 4 vectors set. \
[0 1]T,[1,0]T,[2,3],[4,5]
- Are they LI \
Yes sir.
- Why? \
I was not able to find any coefficient for Ax=0
- Ok , Now generalize \
We can have infinate number of vectos sir
- why \
LD in R2 mean on same line or point 0, we can have infinate number of lines which are different from each other if we choose any 2 they will be LI\
- What is orthogonal vectors \
Those vectors when took dot product give 0.
- Are orthogonal vectos LI \
Yes sir
- Prove it \
(no idea)
- You know what is supervised and unsupervised learning \
In supervised learning we have inputs and labels and we are trying to create a model which predict the label given an input. In case of supervised learing we are given only inputs and the model itself find reation in the data rather thatn we giving it
- You know what naive bias right. What is it
Sir the naive bias asumption is each oservation are indipendet
- It is not entirely true. Can you write it down
(wrote the indipendence forgot to write the conditional part)
- Ok you can leave now
