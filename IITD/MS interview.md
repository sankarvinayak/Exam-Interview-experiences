meeting was through Teams
=
- What are the subjects you prepated for?\
LA, Probability
- It is fine is there any other subjects you are confertable in?\
DBMS,TOC
- assume uniform distribution value for radious r from 0 to r and angle theta from 0 to 360 does that mean the point on the surface of the point is uniformly random\
I think yes
- assume a point on 1/3 2/3 and 1 what is the probability a point being inside these is that same\
No, the probability of larger circle is more
- so what is the contradiction?\
Eventhough the radious and angle are uniformly distributed the point is not
- If there are 10 couple 20 chair 10 opposit pairs what is the probability that the pair sit opposit to each other\
....
- what is the probability of one pair sitting opposit\
Does calculation and 1/19
- can you get this without the calculation?\
if we choose one person and choose a position for that person there are 19 other people and only one out of that 19 is their sopuce hence 1/19

I don't think the IITD classity as CS,IS,TC during interview if you are open to all just say the subjects you are confident in
