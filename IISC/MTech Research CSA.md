Start with LA
Write Ax=b
Let A be mxn what should be the dimension of x
What about b
What is the condition that we have unique solution
Having no free variables 
It is really strong condition right is there any weaker one
b is linear combination of columns of A
Can you express it in terms of rank
Rank of A = what
Rank of A|b
Can we have exactly two solution
No then we have infinite solutions
Can you prove it
Probability
You know what is a fair coin is
What is it, write it in sample space
What is the probability of getting exactly 2 heads
10c2 .5^8 .5^2
Can you explain it
In 10 trials we can choose 2 in 10 c2 ways and 2 heads with probaikity .5 and 8 tail witg .8
Why did you multiply those
Because they are indipendent
What about this 10c2 it is addition right why
Because they are mutually exclusive
A stats a game if head then he win else B plays and repeat until success
What is the probaility that B wins
Does the calculation
Can you explain this
1/3 
Ok now what if A wins
Does the calculation again 2/3
This is conditional probaility right you could have calculates wihout doing the calculation right?
Yes
Why?
Because thay are mutually exclusive
And ..
??
Exhaustive 
Yes sir
Now can you do this without doing any calculation
????
Do you find any relation between the correspondibg terms
One is multiplied with .5 to get other
From that can you infer anything
If A start the game the probability of A winning is twice that of B winning
So we can infer that they are 1/3 and 2/3
