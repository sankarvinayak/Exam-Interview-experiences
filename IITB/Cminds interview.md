Explain your academic background
-
What is your favorite machine learning algorithm like regression,SVM,neural network etc
-
As part of my final year project I have used neural netwotk so.

What is GD
-
Gradient descent is a technique used to optization. The error surface may contain many peak and wally, it take gradient at a point and move in the direction which decrease error

Does GD anways converge go global minima
-
No,It may also end up in local minima

How to choose learning rate
-
we can try different values. Start with larger

But it increase the computation right
-
Yes. Then we can try techniques like AdaGrad..

Don't go to that complex things
-
We can start with a larger value and once the error stop to go down decrease it.

Can we use different learning rate while training
-
Yes sir

What is SGD
-
In GD we make a step after considering all inputs but in SGD we update after one input and in case of mini batch we update after some number of inputs

Advantage over GD
-
It is fast, Less computation

Is there anything else
-
I dont know sir,

Ok , The answer is it avoids local minima.
-
Have studied Probability
-
Yes sir

What are Properties of PDF
-
It is the probability of a event with continous outcome. The probility of a value with infinate pricision is zero. The probability of range is given by the area under.

What are properties of CDF
-

Time complexity of multiplying matrix m1 with s1 nonzero elements and m2 with s2 non zero elements
-
sl*s2 sir 

Think more
-
Sorry sir I am not getting.

Fine. Have you learned Linear algebra.Let A be 20X10 matrix Properties of AA<sup>T</sup>
-
It is square symmetric matrix

Whay about its rank
-
Its rank will be same as that of A

What it can be
-
It will be less than 10 sir

What can you say about its eigne value
-
Its non zero eigne value is same as that of A<sup>T</sup>A
(missed point non negative real )

Ok your answer is correct.Why? Whay can you say about the sign of eigne values
-
Sorry sir I dont know.


Ok.One final question.Explain your final year poject contribution
-
Sir our group project was ... and my contribution was ...

Whay are the field you are intresed in like computer vision..
-
Computer vision sir. I want to ....
